## Module 4 Reflection

After completing the labs and quiz for Module 4, write a short reflection (~300–500 words) addressing the following points.  Use this reflection to consolidate your learning and identify areas for improvement.

### Prompts

1. **AI‑Generated Unit Tests**
   - Summarise the function you selected for Lab 1.  Describe the prompts you used to generate tests and how you iterated on them.  How did AI help you achieve comprehensive coverage【226484627048419†L133-L138】?  What gaps did you identify and how did you fill them?

2. **Integration & Self‑Healing Tests**
   - Describe the workflow you chose for Lab 2 and outline how you built your integration tests.  When you refactored the code, how did the self‑healing features of your AI tool respond【226484627048419†L185-L188】?  Did you need to adjust tests manually?  How did test optimisation affect execution time【226484627048419†L169-L174】?

3. **Flaky Test Debugging**
   - Explain the source of flakiness in your Lab 3 test and detail the steps you took to stabilise it.  What tools or techniques (e.g. retries, mocking, controlling randomness) were most effective【927012084993884†L90-L119】?  How did the AI assistant contribute to identifying or fixing the issue?

4. **Insights & Best Practices**
   - Reflect on how your perception of testing has evolved.  What are the key benefits and limitations of AI‑augmented testing?  How will you integrate AI testing into your daily workflow while maintaining human oversight?  Consider the cost benefits of catching defects early【686955021320324†L224-L227】 and the risks of flaky tests【927012084993884†L132-L140】.

5. **Future Improvements**
   - Identify one area where you could improve your test suite further.  This might include adding more integration tests, experimenting with property‑based testing, or exploring additional AI tools.  Outline a concrete next step.

### Submission

Submit your reflection as a Markdown document in the same repository.  Ensure that you reference the labs and include any relevant code snippets or screenshots.  This reflection will help you internalise Module 4’s concepts and prepare for the refactoring and DevOps modules that follow.
