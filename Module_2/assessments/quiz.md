# Module 2 Quiz – Foundations of AI Tooling & Review

This quiz assesses your understanding of Module 2.  Answer each question in your own words or choose the correct option.  Submit your responses to the trainer for review.

## Multiple‑Choice Questions

1. **Which statement best describes the difference between GitHub Copilot and Roo Code?**
   
   A. Copilot operates as a contextual assistant for single files, while Roo Code can perform multi‑file agentic tasks.
   
   B. Copilot can modify multiple files across a repository, whereas Roo Code only offers inline completions.
   
   C. Copilot requires an index of the project, while Roo Code does not.
   
   D. Roo Code is integrated into Visual Studio but not VS Code.

2. **Why is indexing important in Roo Code?**
   
   A. It caches API responses to reduce latency.
   
   B. It allows the agent to understand file relationships and symbol usages across the workspace.
   
   C. It controls the conversation length in the chat workspace.
   
   D. It restricts the model to a single programming language.

3. **Which of the following is NOT a component of a well‑structured prompt?**
   
   A. Role or perspective
   
   B. Task description
   
   C. Examples
   
   D. Randomness seed

4. **Static analysis tools (e.g. linters) are best at detecting:**
   
   A. Runtime errors caused by invalid input.
   
   B. Logic bugs that only appear in production.
   
   C. Style violations, unused variables and certain security issues.
   
   D. Whether a function returns the correct output for a given test case.

5. **When using an agentic tool like Roo Code to refactor a repository, you should:**
   
   A. Always accept the agent’s changes without review, to save time.
   
   B. Provide a clear description of the desired outcome and review the proposed changes before applying them.
   
   C. Disable indexing to improve performance.
   
   D. Avoid using version control because the agent tracks changes automatically.

## Short‑Answer Questions

6. **Explain in your own words what is meant by “static vs dynamic review” and why both are necessary when working with AI‑generated code.**

7. **Describe a scenario where using Roo Code’s agentic mode would be more beneficial than using Copilot’s inline completions.**

8. **Write a concise prompt for a function that performs an HTTP GET request using the `requests` library, including error handling and type hints.  Include at least three prompt components.**

9. **List two potential risks of relying on AI coding assistants without proper oversight and how you would mitigate them.**

10. **Reflect on your experience in Lab 2: what challenges did you encounter when performing multi‑file refactors, and how did you overcome them?**
